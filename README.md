## WHY THIS EXISTS

WorkHealthLab exists to bring **clarity, rigor, and visual coherence** to social-scientific data visualization — particularly in research on **work, health, inequality, and technological change**.

Most plotting libraries are designed for general analytics or engineering contexts.  
This package is built for **sociological, psychological, and health research**, where figures must balance:

- **Interpretive precision** (e.g., clear moral/semantic color systems),
- **Publication readiness** (consistent fonts, spacing, and annotation),
- **Reproducibility** (functions that produce identical output from standardized scripts).

This allows researchers, students, and collaborators to produce publication-ready visualizations **without manual tweaking or style inconsistency**.
